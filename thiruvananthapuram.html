       <p class="ddetails"><b>Thiruvananthapuram</b>(Trivandrum), lying on the southwest coast of India, is the capital to the state of Kerala. The place is well connected to most of the other major cities of India through rail, road, and air network. Because of its proximity to the sea, the climate of Trivandrum is tropical. This also gives Trivandrum a very pleasant weather round the year. The average maximum temperature can go up to 35.2 degree celsius in summer months and to a minimum of 18.0 degree celsius in the winters. Monsoon comes to Trivandrum in the month of May and remains until November. The city is the state capital and houses many national and state government offices, organizations and companies. It is also a major center of learning and is home to several schools and colleges including Kerala University, and to many scientific institutions, the most prominent being the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST), Technopark, Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB) and Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST). It's distinguished by its British colonial architecture and many art galleries. It’s also home to Kuthira Malika (or Puthen Malika) Palace, adorned with carved horses and displaying collections related to the Travancore royal family, whose regional capital was here from the 18th–20th centuries.
